# aanb

This is a work in progress app to read and display any (Jupyter Notebook) `ipynb` file.

Contains:
 - A file browser where you select the `ipynb` file you would like to view.
 - It will render the file in a manner that relies on [nbcat](https://github.com/moisutsu/nbcat/).
 - It does not currently syntax highlight the codes in the cells. (This may become a todo!).
 - It does not enable any kind of kernel that would allow running cells.  (This may become a todo!).
 

See [Dioxus readme](dioxus-readme.md) for more info about Dioxus and how to build and run.
